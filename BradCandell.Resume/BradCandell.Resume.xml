	<!-- Interests and Activities -->
	<interests>
		<interest title="Family (4 children)">
			My wife and I are the proud parents of four wonderful children. Caleb, Grant, Adeline and Grayson. I have
			the added privelege of being able to raise them in the same home in which I was raised. I am most proud of
			the values that I have been gifted from my parents, and the luxury of handing them down to each of my children.
		</interest>
		<interest title="Camping">
			My family and I enjoy frequent camping trips to many of Wisconsin's State Parks. Our favorite
			is Brunet Island State Park (Cornell) and Perrot State Park (Trempealeau).
		</interest>
		<interest title="Fishing">
			My family and I enjoy fishing during all seasons of the year. We usually seek Largemouth Bass,
			Smallmouth Bass, Northern Pike, and panfish. As much fun as I have catching fish myself, I have
			found that helping my children catch fish is even more enjoyable.
		</interest>
		<interest title="Woodworking">
			Having learned the basic skills from my Grandfather as a young boy, I have been woodworking for
			several decades. I have enjoyed building items that vary from small boxes all the way to furniture
			and cabinets. I have always enjoyed learning new and more difficult skills, and take great pride
			in my woodworking shop.
		</interest>
		<interest title="Remodeling">
			I am the proud owner of the home for which I was born and raised. After being built in the 1870's, it is
			certainly somewhat of an antique on its own. Building upon my woodworking skills, I have taught
			myself how to handle most all aspects of remodeling, from plumbing to drywall.
		</interest>
		<interest title="Antique Restoration">
			As an extension of both Woodworking and Remodeling, I have found great joy in restoring various antiques.
			I have restored several Stanley Hand Planes, an antique mahogany dining room table set and recently a
			rare dining room buffet made in 1901. I have also recently purchased an antique sofa/love seat set from
			1875 that may test my ability to learn new skills!
		</interest>
		<interest title="Microcontrollers">
			Starting with the Arduino and Netduino microcontrollers in 2010, I have enjoyed steadily growing
			my experience with small electronics and microcontrollers. As a developer, I have always enjoyed
			the luxury of creating software to do virtually anything. Microcontrollers have provided me with
			the ability to bring software into the physical world. I have recently began learning more about
			the Photon/Particle ecosystem. I have recently begun planning a custom CNC machine that I can leverage
			in my woodworking shop.
