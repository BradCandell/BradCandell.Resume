        virtualization, hiring and much more.

	<!-- Community Involvement -->
	<community>
		<involvement organization="Cub Scouts (Pack 238)" role="Cubmaster">
			I am proud to serve as the Cubmaster of Cub Scout Pack 238 in Eau Claire, WI. As the Cubmaster, I am responsible for
			leading the entire Pack into success. With a long history of scouting myself, it was very easy to offer my experience
			when called upon. I have the privilege of guiding both a leadership team and the scouts themselves into strengthening 
			the skills and values of the scouting organization.
      
      Starting in 2017, we added a (Frontier) Girls troop to our organization to provide equal opportunities for girls 
      interested in scouting. This rather unorthodox approach has yielded incredible growth and set the stage for having
      completely integrated scouting units.
		</involvement>
		<involvement organization="That Conference" role="Planning Committee &amp; Registration">
      I have the privilege of being part of the team responsible for holding one of the Midwest's largest developer
      conference. "That Conference" is held each year in the Wisconsin Dells, and provides ample learning opportunities for
      over 1200 conference attendees (and their families) to learn about nearly all technologies and platforms. As the conference 
      has grown, the need to specialize has moved me into focusing largely on the registration process at the event. All of the 
      tools to support the conference have been developed internally, and the registration has changed considerably since the 
      first conference.

      I enjoy the (often exhausting) opportunity to talk and/or meet a large number of campers and their families during the 
      registration process and get to know their roles, technological interests and what they are most excited to learn about
      during the conference.
    </involvement>
		<involvement organization="HIPAA COW (Collaborative of Wisconsin)" role="Planning Committee &amp; Networking Group Co-Chair">
      After starting in my role at Group Health, I found it surprisingly impossible to locate avenues for IT professionals to collaborate
      on the impact of HIPAA on technology. I quickly found that areas that I thought would be technical (ie. Security) were often more
      geared to policy and compliance, and less about the technologies that must enforce them.

      I reached out to the President of the HIPAA COW organization in the hopes of forming a technology-specific networking group that
      provided a collaborative space for IT technologists to discuss the aspects of the law and how they have met its requirements.

      In addition to my role as the Co-Chair of the HIPAA COW Healthcare IT Networking Group, I am involved in planning each of the
      bi-annual conferences held throughout the state of Wisconsin. I am proud to have added a completely separate track to the conferences
      for strictly IT content, which has led to significant growth in conference attendance.
    </involvement>
		<involvement organization="Chippewa Valley Technical College (CVTC)" role="Advisory Chair">
      I have been serving as the "Advisory Committee Chair" for the Chippewa Valley Technical College's IT Software Developer program
      for nearly 12 years. In my role I am responsible for leading a group of industry representatives in helping the program shape its
      annual curriculum. Each semester we review the technologies that will be taught and help the college understand the demands we
      are experiencing within the Chippewa Valley.

	<!-- Interests and Activities -->
	<interests>
		<interest title="Family (4 children)">
      My wife and I are the proud parents of four wonderful children. Caleb, Grant, Adeline and Grayson. I have
      the added privilege of being able to raise them in the same home in which I was raised. I am most proud of
      the values that I have been gifted from my parents, and the luxury of handing them down to each of my children.
    </interest>
		<interest title="Camping">
			My family and I enjoy frequent camping trips to many of Wisconsin's State Parks. Our favorite
			is Brunet Island State Park (Cornell) and Perrot State Park (Trempealeau).
		</interest>
		<interest title="Fishing">
			My family and I enjoy fishing during all seasons of the year. We usually seek Largemouth Bass,
			Smallmouth Bass, Northern Pike, and panfish. As much fun as I have catching fish myself, I have
			found that helping my children catch fish is even more enjoyable.
		</interest>
		<interest title="Woodworking">
			Having learned the basic skills from my Grandfather as a young boy, I have been woodworking for
			several decades. I have enjoyed building items that vary from small boxes all the way to furniture
			and cabinets. I have always enjoyed learning new and more difficult skills, and take great pride
			in my woodworking shop.
		</interest>
		<interest title="Remodeling">
			I am the proud owner of the home for which I was born and raised. After being built in the 1870's, it is
			certainly somewhat of an antique on its own. Building upon my woodworking skills, I have taught
			myself how to handle most all aspects of remodeling, from plumbing to drywall.
		</interest>
		<interest title="Antique Restoration">
			As an extension of both Woodworking and Remodeling, I have found great joy in restoring various antiques.
			I have restored several Stanley Hand Planes, an antique mahogany dining room table set and recently a
			rare dining room buffet made in 1901. I have also recently purchased an antique sofa/love seat set from
			1875 that may test my ability to learn new skills!
		</interest>
		<interest title="Microcontrollers">
			Starting with the Arduino and Netduino microcontrollers in 2010, I have enjoyed steadily growing
			my experience with small electronics and microcontrollers. As a developer, I have always enjoyed
			the luxury of creating software to do virtually anything. Microcontrollers have provided me with
			the ability to bring software into the physical world. I have recently began learning more about
			the Photon/Particle ecosystem. I have recently begun planning a custom CNC machine that I can leverage
			in my woodworking shop.
