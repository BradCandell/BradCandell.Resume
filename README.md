# Resume [Brad Candell]

This project contains an XML/XSLT-based resume for Brad Candell, a passionate software 
architect located in Eau Claire, Wisconsin. 

As a longtime fan of the structure and transformative opportunities that XML and XSLT 
can offer, this project shows a unique approach to creating several output formats from 
structured XML data.

The transformations are currently in progress, but will yield a variety of popular formats 
for people submitting their resumes. Because unfortunately, this industry does not (yet) accept 
resumes from programmers in XML or JSON format alone. 

## Transforms
- [ ] BradCandell.Resume.HTML.xslt [**HTML**] - A (Zurb) Foundation-based resume output that provides a beautiful but interactive resume from the resume data.
- [ ] BradCandell.Resume.JSON.xslt [**JSON**] - A transformation into JSON data for implementing through Javascript or RESTful Web Services.
- [ ] BradCandell.Resume.Markdown.xslt [**Markdown**] - Outputs into Github-flavored Markdown.
- [ ] BradCandell.Resume.PDF.xslt [**PDF**] - Outputs the resume into a PDF document using XSL-FO (XSL Formatting Objects).
- [ ] BradCandell.Resume.Word.xslt [**Word**] - Outputs the resume into a Microsoft Word document (docx). 



I hope this project can benefit you in your search of new career opportunities!
